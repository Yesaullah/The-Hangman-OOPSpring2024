# THE HANGMAN




## Introduction
Hangman is a game in which the player is supposed to guess a word letter by letter. A wrong choice of letter results in penalty in the form of loss in the number of allowed wrong choices. The number of allowed wrong choices is set to seven. This project aims to build a console-based application for this game in C++ using concepts of Object-Oriented Programming and through the usage of Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML).

## Project Overview
This Project aims to create a Hangman Game, with a user-friendly and intriguing interface. The program caters all sort of people interested in the Hangman Game. The game offers, three different difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard), with three different word sets integrated in each difficulty level. The player will only be allowed a maximum of seven attempts to guess each word. 

The usage of SFML, allowed the addition of graphics as well as backgorund musics to enhance the player expericnce.
## Important Programming Concepts Covered

Usage of classes, and hence, Abstraction, Polymorphism, and Encapsulation concepts from Object Oriented Programming, made the implementation of the game's logic efficient and easy.

Usage of sprites, textures, musics, key-presses identification, and event handling through the integration of SFML made the implementation quite easy.

Arrays were also made use of to make the lists of words for different categories.

Seperate header and cpp files were used for the implementation of different states of the game.
## Problems Faced

The most diffciult part of writing the code was the usage of SFML, however we were able to take help from the official website of SFMl (https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.6/) and some help was also acquired from youtube videos. It became easy for us as we practiced it more and more helping eachother out throughout the coding process.
